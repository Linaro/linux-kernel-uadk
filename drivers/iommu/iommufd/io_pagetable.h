 * populated in the page table. Each area is fully populated with pages.

 *
 * pages can be NULL, this means some other thread is still working on setting
 * up the area. When observed under the write side of the domain_rwsem a NULL
 * pages must mean no domains are filled.
 *
 * storage_domain points at an arbitrary iommu_domain that is holding the PFNs
 * for this area. It is locked by the pages->mutex. This simplifies the locking
 * as the pages code can rely on the storage_domain without having to get the
 * iopt->domains_rwsem.

 * The iopt_pages::mutex protects pages_node
